# QBM-stuff
This repository contains the Jupyter Notebooks used to generate the figures in my bachelor thesis.  

"Classical Forward Ising Problem.ipynb" was used to generate the figures in section 1  
"Classical Inverse Ising Problem.ipynb" was used to generate the figures in section 2   
"2 Qubit QBM.ipynb" was used to generate the figures in section 3  

Old versions contains old versions of the notebooks that might be useful for future reference
