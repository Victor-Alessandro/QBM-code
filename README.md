# QBM-code
## Description
This repository contains the Jupyter Notebooks used to generate the figures in my bachelor thesis and the final manuscrip '''BSc Thesis - Jasper Pieterse.pdf'''.  

The main notebooks are the "Quantum-Classical Mapping" notebooks. They contain all the relevant code to generate the figures in the thesis. There are two versions. One with explanation and tests and one without. If you want to understand the code, the first version is recommended. If you just want to re-generate the figures and play around with the code, the second version is recommended.

"Boltzmann Machine" contains further information on the Boltzmann machine used in this project.
"Quantum Boltzmann Machine" contains further information on the Quantum Boltzmann machine used in this project.
Both these files are also contained, though stripped down and slightly modified, in the main notebooks.

"Classical Inverse Ising Problem.ipynb" is a separate notebook that uses MCMC and exact calculation to simulate an Ising lattice. This is discussed in the Appendix of the thesis.

## Installation
[Conda 4.9.2](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) can be used to install the virtual environment('environment.yml') used for this code. From within this environment the notebooks can be used as intended.
