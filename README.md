# QBM-code
## Description
This repository contains the Jupyter Notebooks used to generate the figures in my bachelor thesis.  

"Classical Forward Ising Problem.ipynb" was used to generate the figures in section 1  
"Classical Inverse Ising Problem.ipynb" was used to generate the figures in section 2   
"2 Qubit QBM.ipynb" was used to generate the figures in section 3  

## Installation
[Conda 4.9.2](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) can be used to install the virtual environment('environment.yml') used for this code. From within this environment the notebooks can be used as intended.
